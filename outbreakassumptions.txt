## 🦠 DISEASE PARAMETER ASSUMPTIONS

### **COVID-19 Epidemiological Parameters**
- **Incubation Period**: Log-normal distribution
  - Mean: 1.63, Standard Deviation: 0.5
  - **Average**: ~5.2 days from exposure to infectious
  - **Source**: Lauer et al. (2020) - peer-reviewed incubation period study
  
- **Infectious Period**: 7 days
  - **Assumption**: Average time from symptom onset to recovery/isolation
  - **Range**: Covers both symptomatic and asymptomatic infectious periods

### **Transmission Characteristics**
- **Base Transmission Rate**: 1.0 per contact per day
  - **Assumption**: High transmission due to cruise ship confined environment
  - **Rationale**: Accounts for close quarters, shared air circulation, limited outdoor space
  
- **Asymptomatic Fraction**: 46.5%
  - **Source**: Diamond Princess data - 46.5% of infected were asymptomatic
  - **Impact**: These individuals transmit without knowing, continuing normal activities

### **Clinical Outcomes**
- **Case Fatality Rate (CFR)**: 1.3%
  - **Calculation**: 9 deaths ÷ 712 total infections (Diamond Princess)
  - **Assumption**: Accounts for both symptomatic and asymptomatic cases
  
- **Age-Independent Mortality**: Single CFR for all individuals
  - **Simplification**: Ignores age stratification for computational efficiency
  - **Justification**: Focus on intervention effectiveness, not age demographics

## 🔗 NETWORK STRUCTURE ASSUMPTIONS

### **Contact Duration and Frequency**

#### **Cabin Connections (Highest Risk)**
- **Passenger Cabinmates**: 16-20 hours together daily
  - **Assumption**: Sleep, personal time, extended close contact
  - **Weight Calculation**: Near-maximum transmission risk (weight ≈ 1.0)

- **Crew Cabinmates**: 12-16 hours together daily  
  - **Assumption**: Work shifts reduce shared time vs. passengers
  - **Rationale**: Crew work different schedules, less cabin time

- **Assumption**: Close working relationships during operational duties

#### **Passenger-Crew Service Interactions**
- **Service Ratio**: Each service crew serves 10-25 passengers
- **Duration**: 0.1-0.5 hours (brief service encounters)
- **Frequency**: Multiple daily interactions (housekeeping, dining, activities)

#### **Transient Random Encounters**
- **Frequency**: 5 random contacts per person daily
- **Duration**: 0.05-0.2 hours (hallway passing, elevator rides)
- **Purpose**: Models unexpected transmission opportunities

### **Contact Weight Calculation**
- **Formula**: weight = 1 - exp(-duration / 3.0)
- **Saturation Point**: 3 hours (weight approaches 1.0)
- **Assumption**: Exponential increase in transmission risk with contact duration
- **Rationale**: Longer contact = higher viral load exposure

═══════════════════════════════════════════════════════════════════════════════════

## 🎯 INITIAL CONDITIONS AND MODEL SETUP

### **Outbreak Seeding**
- **Initial Infectious**: 100 individuals (2.7% of population)
  - **Assumption**: Significant community transmission before detection
  - **Rationale**: Models realistic cruise ship outbreak where many are already infected

- **Initial Exposed**: 20 individuals
  - **Assumption**: Recent exposures not yet infectious
  - **Purpose**: Creates realistic epidemic progression

- **Geographic Distribution**: Random placement throughout ship
  - **Simplification**: No assumption about outbreak origin location

### **Simulation Parameters**
- **Duration**: 60 days
  - **Rationale**: Covers complete epidemic cycle plus intervention effects
  - **Comparison**: Longer than typical cruise (7-14 days) to see full dynamics

- **Time Step**: Variable (SEIRS+ adaptive)
  - **Advantage**: Captures rapid transmission dynamics during peak periods

### **Recovery and Mortality Rates (Manual Calculation)**
- **Recovery Rate**: 1/7 per day (inverse of 7-day infectious period)
- **Mortality Rate**: (1.3% CFR) × (1/7 per day) = 0.186% per infectious day
- **Assumption**: Deaths occur from infectious population, not after recovery

═══════════════════════════════════════════════════════════════════════════════════

## 🔬 MODEL LIMITATIONS AND SIMPLIFICATIONS

### **Spatial Assumptions**
- **No Cabin Location Effects**: All cabins equally connected to ship networks
- **Uniform Deck Interaction**: No preferential mixing by deck location
- **Simplified Ventilation**: No modeling of air circulation patterns

### **Temporal Assumptions**
- **Static Networks**: Contact patterns don't change over time (except quarantine)
- **No Behavioral Adaptation**: Individuals don't reduce contacts as outbreak progresses
- **Immediate Intervention**: No gradual implementation of quarantine measures

### **Biological Simplifications**
- **No Viral Load Variation**: All infectious individuals equally transmissive
- **No Immunity Waning**: Recovered individuals permanently immune
- **No Reinfection**: SEIRS model assumes temporary immunity, but set to permanent

### **Operational Assumptions**
- **Perfect Information**: Complete knowledge of outbreak status for interventions
- **Unlimited Resources**: No constraints on medical care, isolation facilities
- **No External Factors**: No passenger disembarkation, supply issues, crew changes
