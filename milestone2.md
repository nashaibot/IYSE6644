Milestone 2 Draft:
VS: combined the three write-ups and removed references to the Diamond Princess. Also changed some language to leave things more open-ended in case we decide to shift gears after looking at open-source models for next week’s meeting.

Our team has agreed to focus on a cruise ship flu outbreak scenario. We selected this scenario because we found rapid onboard transmission, driven by high population density, isolated environment, and limited intervention capabilities, makes it particularly interesting for simulating flu spread. Our simulation will pull from the many cases of real-world COVID-19 (and other illness) outbreaks aboard cruise ships. And to support our models, we have pulled relevant research regarding how transmission occurs in the confines of a cruise ship, fatality rates, vaccination rates, response measures, etc. to understand the key variables.
We will structure our models around several core scenarios to create a more comprehensive simulation that also incorporates intervention effectiveness. There will be a base case reflecting typical cruise ship outbreak progression and an aggressive prevention scenario including immediate quarantine measures, among others. We will model different rates of infection and mortality, which can simulate different transmission mechanisms. For example, a more contagious infection mechanism like an airborne cough can be simulated with a higher rate of contagiousness versus a disease which requires physical contact. We are also considering a variety of intervention types, including quarantine, enhanced cleaning procedures, vaccination, etc.
To evaluate scenario outcomes, we've defined at least three metrics: total infection rate over the voyage duration, mortality rate (adjusted for passenger demographics), and epidemic duration measured from first case to last active infection. The model assumes a closed population of several thousand passengers and a few hundred crew members, with a population distribution that skews older and includes families. We can compare this against the typical population distribution.
To encourage collaboration, we’ve created a Git repository where everyone can modify the code/logic and see changes effectively. We are using Python as our main programming language as it has a wide range of libraries available for data manipulation, simulation modeling, and visualization. The structure of the project will be divided into different modules for importing data, parameter configurations, simulation logic, and visualization of results. We also began creating the initial code skeleton with an emphasis on defining class structures for individuals, settings, and transmission events. This modular structure will allow us to process quickly through loops and add additional features such as intervention strategies and comparison of scenarios along the way as the model evolves.

Project Milestone 2: June 27, 2025 (Friday)
All we’re looking for here are a couple of paragraphs describing what you’ve done so far and what you still need to do. Only one team member needs to turn in this assignment, but you must clearly and unambiguously list EVERYONE on the team. Failure to do so will result in loss of points. The intent is not to provide an almost completed report as the TAs will not be grading anything beyond checking to see that you’ve provided the paragraphs. Please do not submit a rough draft copy of your project.

Basic Proposal

Settled on a few simulation scenarios: a variety of diseases with different mortality/infection rates on a cruise ship scenario
Did some research on the real stats of cruise ship infection, so we can benchmark our assumptions and base-case scenario
Started to work on project design, read/researched a few academic papers about cruise ship infection simulations, project designs, methodology
Started a basic simulation in python that represents a very basic/crude version of our scenario 
Git Repo
Formulated two additional scenarios, one being an aggressive prevention scenario when comparing to the base case, and one where no action was taken to combat the spread of the disease.
