Task Points Description, Title & Group, Member Names 5 
Include a descriptive title, the group number, and all group member names at the beginning of your project.

Abstract 5 
A short synopsis (at most 200 words) of what problem you’re working on, including major findings

Background & Description of the Problem 5 
Some details of the problem under investigation (e.g., a literature review along with a description of the organization of what’s coming up in the remainder of the write-up).

Main Findings 50 
The main findings of a project will clearly depend on what type of project you’re doing, how
many people are in the group, etc. Here are some guidelines related to the broad categories
from the original project list document:

Programming-Oriented Problems. These problems are often concerned with Monte
Carlo analysis of a game or preparing an easy-to-use library for some simulation functionality
for us.
• Describe the problem at hand thoroughly and past efforts by others to solve it.
• Develop and document your code.
• Show how to run your program(s).
• Give illustrations of what you can learn from your code (e.g., whether a PRN generator is any good, or whether a certain strategy will work better than others in blackjack). Make
sure to be statistically rigorous (e.g., estimates, confidence intervals, hypothesis tests, etc.)
if you’re carrying out Monte Carlo experiments.


Conclusions 5 
What did you find/learn from the project? Provide ideas for future work that could be built
using your project as a starting point.
