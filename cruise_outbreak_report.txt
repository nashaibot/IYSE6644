ðŸš¢ CRUISE SHIP COVID-19 OUTBREAK SIMULATION - RESULTS REPORT
============================================================

SIMULATION OVERVIEW:

Population: 3,711 individuals (2,666 passengers + 1,045 crew)
Network Structure: 53,483 contact relationships
Simulation Duration: 60 days


SCENARIO COMPARISON:
==================================================

BASELINE:
  â€¢ Attack Rate: 47.9% (1777 infected)
  â€¢ Case Fatality Rate: 1.12% (20 deaths)
  â€¢ Peak Infections: 231 on day 49.8
  â€¢ Final Recovered: 1536

QUARANTINE:
  â€¢ Attack Rate: 12.6% (468 infected)
  â€¢ Case Fatality Rate: 1.28% (6 deaths)
  â€¢ Peak Infections: 137 on day 11.6
  â€¢ Final Recovered: 459

VACCINATION ONE DOSE ALL:
  â€¢ Attack Rate: 8.9% (330 infected)
  â€¢ Case Fatality Rate: 1.27% (4 deaths)
  â€¢ Peak Infections: 100 on day 0.0
  â€¢ Final Recovered: 322

VACCINATION TWO DOSE HALF:
  â€¢ Attack Rate: 15.2% (565 infected)
  â€¢ Case Fatality Rate: 1.24% (7 deaths)
  â€¢ Peak Infections: 100 on day 0.0
  â€¢ Final Recovered: 541

INTERVENTION EFFECTIVENESS:
========================================

QUARANTINE vs BASELINE:
  â€¢ Infections prevented: 1309 (73.7%)
  â€¢ Deaths prevented: 14 (70.1% if baseline>0)
  â€¢ Peak reduction: 94 (40.7%)

VACCINATION ONE DOSE ALL vs BASELINE:
  â€¢ Infections prevented: 1447 (81.4%)
  â€¢ Deaths prevented: 16 (79.0% if baseline>0)
  â€¢ Peak reduction: 131 (56.7%)

VACCINATION TWO DOSE HALF vs BASELINE:
  â€¢ Infections prevented: 1212 (68.2%)
  â€¢ Deaths prevented: 13 (64.8% if baseline>0)
  â€¢ Peak reduction: 131 (56.7%)

VACCINATION STRATEGY COMPARISON:
===================================

ONE DOSE FOR ALL vs TWO DOSES FOR HALF:
  â€¢ One-dose attack rate: 8.9%
  â€¢ Two-dose attack rate: 15.2%
  â€¢ Deaths difference: 3
  â€¢ CONCLUSION: One dose for all is more effective for population protection

KEY FINDINGS:
===============
â€¢ Quarantine reduces peak infections by 40.7%
â€¢ Cruise ship environment enables rapid transmission (attack rates: 8.9%-47.9%)
â€¢ Network structure critical: 53,483 contacts among 3,711 people

METHODOLOGY NOTE:
==================
â€¢ Used SEIRS+ network-based epidemiological modeling
â€¢ Manual state tracking implemented due to library limitations
â€¢ Network structure based on Diamond Princess cruise ship layout
â€¢ Disease parameters calibrated to COVID-19 literature
