ðŸš¢ CRUISE SHIP COVID-19 OUTBREAK SIMULATION - RESULTS REPORT
============================================================

SIMULATION OVERVIEW:

Population: 3,711 individuals (2,666 passengers + 1,045 crew)
Network Structure: 55,681 contact relationships
Simulation Duration: 60 days


SCENARIO COMPARISON:
==================================================

BASELINE:
  â€¢ Attack Rate: 47.6% (1768 infected)
  â€¢ Case Fatality Rate: 1.13% (20 deaths)
  â€¢ Peak Infections: 239 on day 45.9
  â€¢ Final Recovered: 1532

QUARANTINE:
  â€¢ Attack Rate: 15.5% (575 infected)
  â€¢ Case Fatality Rate: 1.28% (7 deaths)
  â€¢ Peak Infections: 163 on day 11.0
  â€¢ Final Recovered: 568

VACCINATION ONE DOSE ALL:
  â€¢ Attack Rate: 7.1% (262 infected)
  â€¢ Case Fatality Rate: 1.25% (3 deaths)
  â€¢ Peak Infections: 100 on day 0.0
  â€¢ Final Recovered: 252

VACCINATION TWO DOSE HALF:
  â€¢ Attack Rate: 18.4% (683 infected)
  â€¢ Case Fatality Rate: 1.23% (8 deaths)
  â€¢ Peak Infections: 119 on day 16.8
  â€¢ Final Recovered: 644

INTERVENTION EFFECTIVENESS:
========================================

QUARANTINE vs BASELINE:
  â€¢ Infections prevented: 1193 (67.5%)
  â€¢ Deaths prevented: 13 (63.0% if baseline>0)
  â€¢ Peak reduction: 76 (31.8%)

VACCINATION ONE DOSE ALL vs BASELINE:
  â€¢ Infections prevented: 1506 (85.2%)
  â€¢ Deaths prevented: 17 (83.6% if baseline>0)
  â€¢ Peak reduction: 139 (58.2%)

VACCINATION TWO DOSE HALF vs BASELINE:
  â€¢ Infections prevented: 1085 (61.4%)
  â€¢ Deaths prevented: 12 (57.9% if baseline>0)
  â€¢ Peak reduction: 120 (50.2%)

VACCINATION STRATEGY COMPARISON:
===================================

ONE DOSE FOR ALL vs TWO DOSES FOR HALF:
  â€¢ One-dose attack rate: 7.1%
  â€¢ Two-dose attack rate: 18.4%
  â€¢ Deaths difference: 5
  â€¢ CONCLUSION: One dose for all is more effective for population protection

KEY FINDINGS:
===============
â€¢ Quarantine reduces peak infections by 31.8%
â€¢ Cruise ship environment enables rapid transmission (attack rates: 7.1%-47.6%)
â€¢ Network structure critical: 55,681 contacts among 3,711 people

METHODOLOGY NOTE:
==================
â€¢ Used SEIRS+ network-based epidemiological modeling
â€¢ Manual state tracking implemented due to library limitations
â€¢ Network structure based on Diamond Princess cruise ship layout
â€¢ Disease parameters calibrated to COVID-19 literature
