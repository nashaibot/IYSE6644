ðŸš¢ CRUISE SHIP COVID-19 OUTBREAK SIMULATION - RESULTS REPORT
============================================================

SIMULATION OVERVIEW:

Population: 3,711 individuals (2,666 passengers + 1,045 crew)
Network Structure: 59,038 contact relationships
Simulation Duration: 60 days


SCENARIO COMPARISON:
==================================================

BASELINE:
  â€¢ Attack Rate: 48.5% (1798 infected)
  â€¢ Case Fatality Rate: 1.30% (21 deaths)
  â€¢ Peak Infections: 245 on day 42.6
  â€¢ Final Recovered: 1587

QUARANTINE:
  â€¢ Attack Rate: 14.2% (529 infected)
  â€¢ Case Fatality Rate: 1.30% (7 deaths)
  â€¢ Peak Infections: 150 on day 10.0
  â€¢ Final Recovered: 522

VACCINATION ONE DOSE ALL:
  â€¢ Attack Rate: 7.5% (278 infected)
  â€¢ Case Fatality Rate: 1.30% (4 deaths)
  â€¢ Peak Infections: 100 on day 0.0
  â€¢ Final Recovered: 275

VACCINATION TWO DOSE HALF:
  â€¢ Attack Rate: 17.6% (655 infected)
  â€¢ Case Fatality Rate: 1.30% (8 deaths)
  â€¢ Peak Infections: 120 on day 14.5
  â€¢ Final Recovered: 617

INTERVENTION EFFECTIVENESS:
========================================

QUARANTINE vs BASELINE:
  â€¢ Infections prevented: 1270 (70.6%)
  â€¢ Deaths prevented: 14 (67.1% if baseline>0)
  â€¢ Peak reduction: 95 (38.8%)

VACCINATION ONE DOSE ALL vs BASELINE:
  â€¢ Infections prevented: 1520 (84.5%)
  â€¢ Deaths prevented: 17 (82.7% if baseline>0)
  â€¢ Peak reduction: 145 (59.2%)

VACCINATION TWO DOSE HALF vs BASELINE:
  â€¢ Infections prevented: 1144 (63.6%)
  â€¢ Deaths prevented: 13 (61.1% if baseline>0)
  â€¢ Peak reduction: 125 (51.0%)

VACCINATION STRATEGY COMPARISON:
===================================

ONE DOSE FOR ALL vs TWO DOSES FOR HALF:
  â€¢ One-dose attack rate: 7.5%
  â€¢ Two-dose attack rate: 17.6%
  â€¢ Deaths difference: 4
  â€¢ CONCLUSION: One dose for all is more effective for population protection

KEY FINDINGS:
===============
â€¢ Quarantine reduces peak infections by 38.8%
â€¢ Cruise ship environment enables rapid transmission (attack rates: 7.5%-48.5%)
â€¢ Network structure critical: 59,038 contacts among 3,711 people

METHODOLOGY NOTE:
==================
â€¢ Used SEIRS+ network-based epidemiological modeling
â€¢ Manual state tracking implemented due to library limitations
â€¢ Network structure based on Diamond Princess cruise ship layout
â€¢ Disease parameters calibrated to COVID-19 literature
