Project Milestone 2: June 27, 2025 (Friday)
All we’re looking for here are a couple of paragraphs describing what you’ve done so far and what you still need to do. Only one team member needs to turn in this assignment, but you must clearly and unambiguously list EVERYONE on the team. Failure to do so will result in loss of points. The intent is not to provide an almost completed report as the TAs will not be grading anything beyond checking to see that you’ve provided the paragraphs. Please do not submit a rough draft copy of your project.


Project Milestone 3: July 21, 2025
Please submit 2 files as a part of submission (if you chose a non-coding-based topic then you only need to provide your report). One file will be a pdf file, which will cover your final project report. The PDF must be separate from the zip file.

The second file should be a zip file, which will cover all the code documents, Arena file, and any other file you may think important to submit. We do not need every single individual file that you have ever created while working on your project nor do we need the entire version control history of any source code. Please include a README file in the zip folder, explaining what each file is, so that we can evaluate your projects easily. If your download is failing to Canvas, then that means the file is too large and you have included files that are not required to adequately assess your project. You cannot submit links to Google Docs, GitHub, or any other online link to the content of your project.

For each group, only one person from that group needs to submit the project files.


WE HAVE DECIDED PROJECT 14

Project 3:

(1–2 members) Pandemic Flu Spread. Consider a classroom of 61 elementary school
kids. 60 of the kids are healthy (and susceptible to flu) on Day 1. Tommy (the
61st kid) walks in with the flu and starts interacting with his potential victims. To
keep things simple, let’s suppose that Tommy comes to school every day (whether
or not he’s sick) and will be infectious for 3 days. Thus, there are 3 chances for
Tommy to infect the other kids — Days 1, 2, and 3. Suppose that the probability
that he infects any individual susceptible kid on any of the three days is p = 0.01;
and suppose that all kids and days are independent (so that you have i.i.d. Bern(p)
trials). If a kid gets infected by Tommy, he will then become infectious for 3 days
as well, starting on the next day.
(a) What is the distribution of the number of kids that Tommy infects on Day 1?
(b) What is the expected number of kids that Tommy infects on Day 1?
(c) What is the expected number of kids that are infected by Day 2 (you can
count Tommy if you want)?
(d) Simulate the number of kids that are infected on Days 1,2,. . . . Do this many
times. What are the (estimated) expected numbers of kids that are infected
by Day i, i = 1, 2, . . .? Produce a histogram detailing how long the “epidemic”
will last.
(e) What if each kid has a 50–50 chance of already being immunized (and the
immunization works perfectly)?


Project 4:

4. (1–2) members) Pandemic Flu Spread (differential equation version). Look up and model in something like MATLAB a continuous-time SEIR (susceptible-exposed-
infectious-removed) pandemic flu spread model or one of its variants. This is a de-
terministic, differential equations model that is nonetheless a simulation. I believe that MATLAB and maybe even R have packages that will make this a reasonable undertaking. I’d expect you to provide a tutorial, in addition to several examples, and some general conclusions.

Project 14:

(2–4 members) “Advanced” Pandemic Flu Spread. Project 3 considered a (trivial) discrete-event simulation of pandemic flu spread in a classroom. (Project 4 concerned a continuous-time, deterministic simulation that doesn’t apply here.) If you feel a little more adventuresome, I’d like you to think about a bigger-and-better simulation involving a larger population. 

Here’s a potential scenario (there are many other interesting ones — feel free to be imaginative):
• Some infectious people enter a population of susceptibles, and some of the
susceptibles become infected.
• There is a short period of a couple of days before a newly-infected person in
turn becomes infectious.
• When a person recovers (or dies), the person is not again susceptible.
• Infectiousness or death can be mitigated by masking, social distancing, etc.
• Infectiousness or death can be mitigated by vaccination. Vaccines can be
delivered in one or two doses. But there could be supply chain issues.
• Even if a vaccine requires two doses, the vaccine nevertheless provides partial
immunization after even only one dose. Might you immediately give everyone
only one dose instead of two, and hope that the supply chain catches up so
that you can “eventually” give everyone two doses?

To determine whether a particular strategy is any good, you probably ought to consider the number of people who eventually get infected (or die), the length of the epidemic, etc.
